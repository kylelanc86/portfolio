            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kyle. I am relatively new to the world of programming having formally starting my education in the field in 
                2023. In the past I ran my own environmental consultancy which was a very educational and enjoyable experience. After 15 years
                in that field, I decided I wanted a change. In early 2024 my partner gave brith to my daughter, Maeve, and I decided i wanted
                a career which offered me more dlexibility in terms of hours, working from home etc. rather than a site-based job where my time was
                dictated by client requirements. 
            <br>
            <p>Over the past 12 months I have learnt much about HTML, CSS and Javascript and have utilised my new skills to develop a variety of 
                webistes, both client-paid projects and projects I have taken on simply to improve my skillset. This webpage details some of the 
                websites I have developed along with details on techniques I have utilised.</p> <br> 
            <h3>Study & Development</h3>
            <h4>CS50</h4>
            <p>From January 2024 I began following the Harvard CS50 programming course which gave an overarching understanding in programming and
                problem solving. Whilst I enjoyed this course and found it interesting, I struggled with what I felt as a chasm between the taught
                content and the requirements for the problem sets. The course did a good job of reinforcing my interest, but after completing the
                8th week of the course I decided to abandon the course. I consider myself a good problem solver, however because at this point in
                my learning journey I still have a lot to learn, I think that I will enjpy the course and get more out of the problem solving elements
                once I have a better skillset. 
            </p> <br>
            <h4>CodeAcademy</h4>
            <p>From May 2024, after a bit of research on different educational tools, I decided to sign up for CodeAcademy. As I am working from home 
                and dealing with a young infant it was important for me that I followed a program which was easy to follow and pick up for even small 
                periods of time. I also enjopyed the concept that you could follow a 'syllabus' which is orientated towards a specific role.As of August
                2024 I am half way through a full-stack engineer syllabus which I am hoping will give me a broad understanding of the full spectrum of 
                roles open to a programmer before I focus on a specific pathway.

            <h4>No. 9 Cafe Website</h4>
            <p>To help build my early understanding of website building, particularly HTML and CSS, I offered to build a website for some friends
                of mine who were starting up their own cafe. The website was designed with a one page set up a

            <h4>Portfolio Website</h4>
            <p>Once I had a few projects completed, I decided to build this website to log my progress. I felt this would help encourage me by
                displaying my progress and also to display my knowledge to prospective employers.It is fairly basic at the moment and I do plan
                to improve the website, particularly with additional Javascript, soon.
